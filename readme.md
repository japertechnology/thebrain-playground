# The Brain API Playground and XKCD your Brain

# TheBrain API Playground

This Jupyter Notebook, [BrainAPI.ipynb](https://github.com/MattGyverLee/TheBrain-API-Playground/blob/main/BrainAPI.ipynb), contains a set of cells that interact with TheBrain API. The first cell imports necessary modules and reads in API keys and target brain information from environment variables. The following cells define functions to interact with the API, including listing brains, scanning brains, listing types and tags, searching for thoughts, and retrieving named items. Each of these functions is demonstrated in a separate cell.

Before running the notebook, set the `BRAIN_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key and optionally `BRAIN_TARGET_ID` with your Brain's ID.

Note: This Version of the playground supports some writing calls, but you should look at XKCD to see them in action.

# XKCD your Brain

This Jupyter Notebook, [XKCD.ipynb](https://github.com/MattGyverLee/TheBrain-API-Playground/blob/main/XKCD.ipynb), contains a set of cells that interact with TheBrain API to add `xkcd` comics to your brain.

Before running the notebook, set the `BRAIN_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key and optionally `BRAIN_TARGET_ID` with your Brain's ID.

Create a single thought called `xkcd`. Set your comic range on Cell 5. Run all steps. It might be a good idea to do small batches.
