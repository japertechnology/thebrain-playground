# Weakness Report

## Security

### Insecure API Key Storage
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Files/Locations**: BrainAPI.ipynb, XKCD.ipynb, readme.md
- **Description**: API keys are read from a plain text file (`APIKey.txt`), and usage instructions encourage storing sensitive credentials in this unencrypted file. This approach increases risk of credential leakage or accidental commit.
- **Recommendation**: Load API keys from environment variables or a secrets manager; avoid storing credentials on disk and document secure handling practices.

### Broad Exception Handling
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Files/Locations**: BrainAPI.ipynb, XKCD.ipynb
- **Description**: The notebooks use bare `except:` clauses when reading the API key, which suppresses all errors and can conceal security or runtime issues.
- **Recommendation**: Catch specific exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`) and log or re-raise unexpected errors to aid debugging and monitoring.

## Code Quality

### Hard-coded Configuration
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Files/Locations**: BrainAPI.ipynb, XKCD.ipynb
- **Description**: Critical parameters such as API base URL and target brain IDs are hard-coded within the notebooks, limiting reusability and making maintenance error-prone.
- **Recommendation**: Externalize configuration through environment variables, configuration files, or command-line arguments.

### Lack of Project Structure and Tests
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Files/Locations**: Entire repository
- **Description**: The project consists solely of Jupyter notebooks with no modular Python modules or automated tests, hindering scalability and reliability.
- **Recommendation**: Refactor core logic into Python packages/modules, add unit tests, and integrate continuous testing to ensure correctness.

## Interface

### Manual Credential and Parameter Setup
- **Severity**: Low
- **Affected Files/Locations**: readme.md, BrainAPI.ipynb, XKCD.ipynb
- **Description**: Users must manually create `APIKey.txt` and `target.txt` files to configure credentials and target IDs, which can lead to setup errors and poor user experience.
- **Recommendation**: Provide a configuration interface or helper script that validates inputs and guides users through setup.
